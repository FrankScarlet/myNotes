# Recent Advances in Zero-shot Recognition
## Index Terms
open-set recognition, zero-shot recognition

## Introduction

## Overview

common semantic representations include semantic attributes and semantic word vectors, representation termed *class prototype*

## Semantic Representations in ZSR

- *Semantic Attributes*
    - User-defined attributes
    - relative attributes
    - data-driven attributes
    - video attributes

- *Semantic Rpresentations Beyond Attributes*
    - Concept ontology
    - semantic word vectors

## Models for ZSR
learn an embedding and do recognition

- *Embedding Models*
    - Bayesian Models: DAP & IAP
    - Semantic Embedding
    - Embedding into Common Spaces
    - deep embedding
- *Recognition Models in the Embedding Space*
- *Problems in Zero-shot Recognition*
    - Projection Domain Shift Problems
    - Hubness Problem

## Beyond Zero-Shot Recognition

- *Generalized Zero-shot Recognition and Open-set Recognition*
    - Conventional open set recognition
    - Generalized open set recognition
- *One-shot recognition*
    - Direct Supervised Learning-based Approaches
    - Transfer Learning-based One-shot Recognition

## Datasets in ZSR

## Future Research Directions

- *More Generalized and Realistic Setting*
- *Combining Zero-shot with Few-shot Learning*
- *Beyond object categories*
- *Curriculum learning*
