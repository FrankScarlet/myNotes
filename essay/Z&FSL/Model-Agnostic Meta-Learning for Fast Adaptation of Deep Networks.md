# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks
## Abstract
The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples.
classification, regression, and policy gradient reinforcement learning.
## Introduction
a simple model and task-agnostic algorithm for meta-learning that trains a model's parameters such that a small number of gradient updates will lead to fast learning on a new task
## Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
### Meta-Learning Problem Set-Up 
During meta-learning, the model is trained to be able to adapt to a large or infinite number of tasks.
### A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithm
The MAML meta-gradient update involves a gradient through a gradient.
$$ {\theta}'_i = \theta - \alpha $$
$$ ss$$
$$ \theta $$
